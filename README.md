## Working popup killer\.\.


</div>

### Description

Its a working popup killer for IE. Doesn't have Netscape support yet.

I found the actual IE classes somewhere on this site and I don't know who actually created them.. So credit is given where due I guess..

Other than that, start the program up, minimize it to the tray, and watch it kill popups. btw, if you hold CTRL down, it will allow the popup.
